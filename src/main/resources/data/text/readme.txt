# Config #
##########
Configuration is done in the config folder, all .yml files are read on startup and merged into one file for the
plugin to read, this is done to make the config files easier read and understand.
The main configuration settings for Graves is in config/grave.yml
If the configuration is outdated, it will automatically update your configurations and will also generate a backup of the old configuration.
